This repository contains all related codes of our paper "Bounce Filter: A Framework for Accelerating Traffic Measurement through Small Flow Filtering".

## Introduction

Traffic measurement provides crucial statistics for network management, serving as the foundation for various applications such as quality of service, network billing,
load balancing, and anomaly detection. However, the scarcity of resources on network devices restricts measurement solutions to providing only approximate results. Meanwhile, high-proportion small flows in network traffic further compromise the measurement accuracy. In this paper, we design Bounce Filter to accelerate traffic measurement and improve accuracy. Bounce Filter utilizes reversible counters to capture small flows, enhancing the filtering capability. Moreover, it relies on one-direction communication, and each packet only updates one counter without costly operations. Bounce Filter can be applied to various measurement tasks, and improves measurement accuracy. Experiments on CAIDA IP traces show improvements achieved by Bounce Filter in measurement tasks. In flow size estimation, Bounce Filter reduces the estimation error by three orders of magnitude and achieves 49Ã— higher throughput than the seminal scheme. Bounce Filter is implemented on software and hardware.
